The business background of this system shows that the following routine questionnaire method plays an increasingly important role in statistical analysis of various industries, and many data are collected through the extensive use of questionnaire and interview methods. In order to further understand the deep-seated needs and conditions of the investigated objects, do a good job in statistical analysis and investigation, and reflect the situation of investigators more objectively and accurately, it is necessary to design and practice a questionnaire survey system. The questionnaire system is built on the basis of the Internet, and constructs a questionnaire design, release, statistics and content collection system relying on the network.

Traditional paper questionnaires have high cost of designing and printing, and it is troublesome to store paper questionnaires as archival materials. The process of issuing, collecting and statistics of questionnaires is complicated, which is easy to produce statistical errors of missing and discarded questionnaires, and the controllability of questionnaires is poor. The content of statistics and analysis is difficult, and the overall effect is not good.

The questionnaire system based on the Internet can efficiently carry out a large number of questionnaires and enhance the objectivity of the survey results, so that the respondents will not be affected to answer the questionnaires, and facilitate the information preservation of the survey work. Compared with the questionnaire conducted on the commercial website, the system can also be deployed in the Intranet to improve data confidentiality.
This project is a college satisfaction questionnaire system.
This document provides an overview of the environment and tools required for the system. This includes, but is not limited to, operating systems, development tools, databases, version control systems, etc. The selection and configuration of these environments and tools enables team members to collaborate on the same platform and use the same standards and processes to manage the code base. This helps improve development efficiency, code quality, and maintainability.
