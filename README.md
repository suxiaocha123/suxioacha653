This project is a college satisfaction questionnaire system.
This document provides an overview of the environment and tools required for the system. This includes, but is not limited to, operating systems, development tools, databases, version control systems, etc. The selection and configuration of these environments and tools enables team members to collaborate on the same platform and use the same standards and processes to manage the code base. This helps improve development efficiency, code quality, and maintainability.
